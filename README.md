# Cinema Sips

#### Deployed Project


## Description
As a user, I want to find a movie and cocktail that matches my mood, so that I can spend more time enjoying myself and less time searching through streaming sites. 
As a user, I want to be able to pick how many movies and drinks are suggested so that I can limit or expand my decision process.
